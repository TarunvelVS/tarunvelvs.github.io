                        I created a RAG pipeline for efficient text analysis of PDFs, aimed at simplifying interview preparation. This tool leverages the all-mpnet-base-v2 sentence transformer from HuggingFace for quick, relevant data retrieval from extensive texts, allowing for interactive querying and reducing study time. This self-service tool demonstrates the practical application of NLP models and has enhanced my skills in NLP and model deployment.

                        I refined a predictive model to forecast customer churn by employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The initial stage involved meticulous data preprocessing and exploratory analysis using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to ensure data quality and glean insights. Subsequently, the model was constructed and trained using TensorFlow to accurately predict churn likelihood.

        I enhanced data quality and utility by cleaning and transforming 100K healthcare records, identifying outliers and discerning patterns through exploratory data analysis coupled with statistical methods. The Logistic Regression model was fine-tuned through threshold adjustments to optimize performance. Additionally, I leveraged GridsearchCV and Cross-Validation to effectively prune the Decision Tree and fine-tune the KNN Classifier, resulting in a Logistic Regression model with fewer false negatives and an improved recall rate of 80%.

                        This project entailed a thorough analysis of insurance datasets to pinpoint determinants of insurance premiums, employing Python and pandas for data manipulation. I applied rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to enhance the quality and reliability of the data, setting the stage for accurate predictive modeling. Through exploratory data analysis, I extracted valuable insights into customer profiles and insurance expenses, laying bare the data's intrinsic trends. Statistical techniques were harnessed to dissect the influence of age, BMI, and smoking status on insurance charges, culminating in practical recommendations for premium structuring. The project's conclusions were synthesized into clear visual narratives using Python's robust visualization libraries, thus empowering stakeholders to make informed strategic decisions.

                        This project leveraged Zomato's dataset for a deep-dive analysis into what drives restaurant ratings and customer choices. Using Python, along with seaborn and matplotlib for visualization, I performed data cleaning and EDA to unearth the influence of location, cuisine, and consumer reviews on ratings. Statistical methods helped establish a link between restaurant attributes and customer satisfaction, informing strategies for service and marketing improvements. Key insights were translated into clear visualizations to guide stakeholders in refining the dining experience.
